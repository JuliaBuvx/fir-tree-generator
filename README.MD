# Fir Tree Generator

This simple Python script allows you to generate a fir tree pattern and save it to a file. The tree is created based on the number of levels you input, and the output is saved to the specified file path.

## Usage

1. Run the script `tree_app.py`.
2. Enter the number of levels for the fir tree when prompted. The number must be between 3 and 1000.
3. Enter the path to the output file where you want to save the fir tree.

## Features

- **Tree Generation:** The script generates a fir tree pattern with a specified number of levels.
- **Input Validation:** The input for the number of levels is validated to ensure it falls within the allowed range.
- **File Output:** The generated tree is saved to a specified file.

## Acceptance Tests

A set of acceptance tests is provided to ensure the script's proper functionality. These tests cover valid and invalid inputs, as well as file path validations.

## How to Run Tests

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the script's directory.
3. Run the command `python test_tree_app.py`.

Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
